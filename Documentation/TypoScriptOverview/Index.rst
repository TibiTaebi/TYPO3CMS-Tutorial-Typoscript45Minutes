TypoScript - A quick overview
-----------------------------

Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The goal of this introduction is not to leave you with the thought,
"It's finally working!", but with the thought of "Finally, I know HOW it works!".
In other words, this introduction is designed to give you a
comprehensive understanding of how TypoScript works.

A common TYPO3 CMS workflow used by beginners is to try arbitrary
properties to objects until things somehow begin to work.
Understanding how TypoScript works, however, allows you to work more quickly
and more efficiently with TYPO3 CMS.
Troubleshooting is easier and time is saved by learning TypoScript properly.
Otherwise, you risk going through a "hit-or-miss" process.

The goal of this introduction is not to have a running TYPO3
installation at the end, but to offer an explanation of *why* and *how*
TypoScript works.

Understanding this tutorial, TypoScript in 45 Minutes, is foundational
for other tutorials, like :ref:`Templating Tutorial: Basics <t3templating:start>`.
